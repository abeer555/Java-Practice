# Java Practice

This is my personal collection of Java programs that I've written for practice and learning purposes. It covers various concepts and algorithms in Java programming.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal coding playground for Java. It contains programs I've written to:

- Explore different Java concepts
- Practice algorithm implementations
- Solve coding challenges
- Experiment with various programming techniques

## Contents

The repository includes Java programs covering:

- Array manipulations
- Number system conversions (Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, Octal)
- Mathematical algorithms
- String operations
- Sorting algorithms
- Matrix operations
- Simple games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Encryption techniques
- Recursion examples

## File Structure

Each `.java` file in this repository represents a different program or concept I've worked on. Some notable files include:

- `B2D.java`, `D2B.java`: My practice with number system conversions
- `BubbleSortStr.java`, `SelectionSort.java`: My implementations of sorting algorithms
- `CaesarCipher.java`: My attempt at implementing the Caesar cipher
- `TicTacToe.java`: A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I created

## Personal Use

This repository is primarily for my personal use and reference. I use it to:

- Track my progress in learning Java
- Revisit and refine my implementations
- Keep a record of the concepts I've practiced

## Note

As this is a personal repository, it may contain incomplete or experimental code. The programs here reflect my learning journey and may not always represent best practices or optimal solutions.
